# Fraudulent-Transaction-Prediction

## Dataset Description
The dataset used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/transactions-fraud-datasets) was obtained from Kaggle. This comprehensive financial dataset combines transaction records, customer information, and card data from a banking institution, spanning across the 2010s decade. The dataset is designed for multiple analytical purposes, including synthetic fraud detection, customer behavior analysis, and expense forecasting. The available dataset is very large. To save model training time, only data from 2016 onward will be used.

## Business Understanding
Fraud is the act of intentionally deceiving others to gain an unfair or illegal advantage, often causing harm to another party. One of the most common cases occurs in the banking sector. Such actions may include scams, data manipulation, or tricking banks, customers, or other people. For examples: fictitious credit applications, transaction data manipulation, account hacking, and so on. These activities can cause significant losses to various parties. Therefore, it’s important to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, as well as to regularly *monitor transactions to identify any that may appear suspicious or fraudulent*. <br>
- Goal     : Reducing losses from fraudulent transactions by improving the detection rate of whether a transaction is suspected to be fraudulent or not. <br>
- Problem  : Building a binary machine learning classification model to predict whether a transaction is suspected to be fraudulent based on customer transaction data. <br>
